As a Director of Engineering at Foursquare, if you could have a five-minute conversation with anyone who knows me, you will hear: I'm driven, lovely, carry hand sanitizer in my car because I have a thing with dirty ATM buttons and gas station pumps. I’m optimistic, I love learning new things, I believe I am a loyal person, well-traveled, and enjoy life. I’m a proven leader of advocating developmental and authenticity through seminars in the tech community, enjoy tidiness, practice yoga, competitive at everything, dance in my car, and give credit when it's due. One of the perks of my job is to interact with humans across the globe daily. I want to understand the why's and where's, I laugh at my own jokes because I think I'm hilarious. I provide enlightenment on dreary days to my team. I coordinate my closet by sleeve length and color and cannot live without music at all times.

Evolving technology, social media platforms, and developing people are my passions and areas of expertise. These skills I have acquired have created a solid foundation that enables me to manage and lead people effectively.

What you can expect from me/What I expect from you:

I am incredibly direct in my communications and create clarity for my team. Communication isn’t just talking at people; it is taking with people. I am adaptive in my style of communication to whatever works best for my audience. I expect you to be direct with communications with me. Say what you mean, do not sugar-coat things to make things palatable.

I promise to listen and give you feedback on a daily/weekly basis. We will engage in difficult conversations together and be uncomfortable at times. Please do the same with me so that I can increase my own self-awareness.

Coaching you is one of my number one priorities. I take time out of my schedule to focus on professional and personal development. I want you to feel challenged and supported by me. At the same time, I need you to step out of your comfort zone and really dig into your growth edges with me and be open to feedback. Feedback isn’t always the easiest thing to get into, but we will do it together.

Relentless is something you can describe when we talk about my commitment to you and to Foursquare. We will produce excellent results by being relentless with our commitments. I expect you to be in it with me and constantly re-evaluate decisions or priorities.

Time is important to me- isn’t it to you as well? It is ALL we have. So let’s make the most of that time together. If we have meetings that should not be on the calendar, let’s re-evaluate them. When it comes to time, I am not a micromanager. I despise the term; actually. We are all adults and we can manage our time. If you need help, I am here to help you plan out things.

I am ready to give it 110% and dig in with you- are you in?

Growth Edges

Handstands? Is that something that I can say? On a serious note, I want everyone to grow here at Foursquare but also to expand that growth outside of here. That is why the first thing on my list is handstands. Can someone really do the perfect one? (Fun Fact: I teach/practice yoga)

Listening- Listening is something that I will be practicing when I am 80 years old. At that point, it may just be turning up my hearing-aid. But we’ve got time.

With Gratitude and Looking forward to being in it with you.
